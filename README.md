requests, scripting, and visualization in a single platform.

DataStation can run as a web application in server mode or as a
desktop application in desktop mode. Desktop mode makes it easy for
you to get started scripting your data. Server mode makes it possible
to share reports and schedule exports.

## Features

In server mode:

* Create and share dashboards with coworkers behind auth
* Schedule recurring exports of dashboards

In desktop mode and server mode:

* Build reports with graphs, charts and tables
* Import all of your data without ETL processes, just basic API access
  * Query all kinds of databases, locally or over SSH
  * Query HTTP servers, locally or over SSH
  * Read all kinds of files from disk, locally or over SSH
* Script against data in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Julia, or R
* Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux
