# DataStation Community Edition

DataStation makes it easy to build cross-cutting reports on top of
database queries, API requests, files, and custom scripts without
requiring ETL processes or maintenance of a new large database.

Developers can try it out as a desktop application on their laptop
(data never leaves the laptop). Or the application can be installed as
a server so the entire team can build and view dashboards.
