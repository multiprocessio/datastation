## About

DataStation is an open-source data IDE for developers. It allows you
to easily build graphs and tables with data pulled from SQL databases,
logging databases, metrics databases, HTTP servers, and all kinds of
text and binary files. Need to join or munge data? Write embedded
scripts as needed in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, R, or Julia. All in one
application.

## Install

Install instructions are available [here](https://datastation.multiprocess.io/docs/).

## Try out the demo

See [here](https://app.datastation.multiprocess.io/) for the free
online demo.

It uses in-memory evaluation so your data never leaves your
machine/browser. Because it runs in browser memory it has some
limitations that the desktop and server versions don't.
